Let's Play Wheel of Fortune!

For each turn, you will have the opportunity to: spin the wheel and earn a cash value for every
correctly guessed consonant, purchase a vowel for $250 flat, or attempt to solve the puzzle.
Once all letters have been revealed, please input the word to successfully solve the puzzle.
If you correctly solve the puzzle during the round, you will win $1000 plus any money you won 
throughout the round. If you do not correctly guess or reveal the word in the puzzle, 
you will lose the round and unfortunately not keep any of your round money. 

Two regular rounds will be played. The player who has the most total banked money will proceed to 
the final round.

Let's play Round One!
